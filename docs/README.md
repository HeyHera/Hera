# Hera - An Operating System Level Voice Recognition Package
Our project propose a new way of interacting with the operating system that prioritizes on improving the user experience via voice commands. It is able to recognize the spoken language and is able to draw meaningful conclusions from it and to provide responses accordingly.

## Introduction
Our project propose a new way of interacting with the operating system that prioritizes on improving the user experience via voice commands. 
It is able to recognize the spoken language and is able to draw meaningful conclusions from it and to provide responses accordingly. 
Unlike the traditional approach which rely heavily on the physical inputs, our proposed system can provide an alternative method through the means of voice interactions. 
Though we are developing a voice based system, the traditional physical input is still available, so the user can experience the best of both worlds.

## Methodology
For effective and efficient embedding of speech recognition into Linux Operating System, we employ a multimodule approach, namely Assistant, Coordinator and Skill modules.
These modules determine how the voice data is collected, processed and evaluated. The entire working of the system is divided into two phases,
Assistant-Coordinator (Primary) phase and Coordinator-Skill-Synthesis (Secondary) phase.
The primary phase consist of transcribing the voice data to the corresponding intents.
The secondary phase deals with mapping intents into corresponding skills and providing feedback in the form of speech or raw data.
